## Image Optimization Guidelines

### File Sizes:
- Hero images: Max 200KB (use JPEG at 80-85% quality)
- Service images: Max 100KB each
- Logos: PNG format with transparency
- Gallery images: Max 150KB each

### SEO Best Practices:
1. **File Names**: Use descriptive names with keywords
   - Good: `restaurant-kitchen-cleaning-los-angeles.jpg`
   - Bad: `IMG_12345.jpg`

2. **Alt Text**: Already added in HTML, describes image content and includes keywords

3. **Compression Tools**:
   - Use TinyPNG.com for PNG files
   - Use JPEG-Optimizer.com for JPEG files
   - Or use local tools like ImageOptim

### How to Add Images:

1. **Create the images folder:**
```bash
mkdir "C:\Users\JacobShure\spruce website\images"
mkdir "C:\Users\JacobShure\spruce website\images\gallery"
mkdir "C:\Users\JacobShure\spruce website\images\blog"
```

2. **Download images from your Google Drive**

3. **Rename according to the list above**

4. **Optimize file sizes**

5. **Place in appropriate folders**

## CSS Already Prepared

The styles.css file already has styling for:
- Service card images
- Hero background
- Gallery grid
- Responsive image handling

## Where Images Will Appear:

### Homepage (index.html):

## Quick Implementation:

Once you've added the images to the folders, the website will automatically display them. The HTML references are already in place with proper alt text for SEO.

## Missing Images Fallback:

If any images are missing, the site will still function but with:
